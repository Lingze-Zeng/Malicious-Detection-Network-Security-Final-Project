Gilgamesh was the\\nfifth king of the Sumerian city of Uruk after the Great Flood. Under his rule, about 2500\\nBC, Uruk conquered the surrounding city-states and established something like a small\\nnation. For two thousand years Gilgamesh survived in the Near East as an epic hero. There\\nare versions of his story in Hittite, Hurrian, Canaanite, Sumerian, and Assyrian, and the\\ndim memory of his fame in the Koran. The most complete text comes from Assurbanipal&#146;s\\nlibrary, formed just before the destruction of Nineveh in the seventh century BC. The\\nstory seems to have taken form almost two thousand years before that. Considering the\\ndisparity of cultures and languages, the great stretch of time, the means of reproduction\\nand communication, <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is one of the most popular stories ever\\ntold. </p>\\n\\n<p>Rightly so. It may be the first, but it is a highly developed fictional narrative. It\\nis not a myth. Even to call it an epic requires a stretching of the definition. It is more\\nlike a novel of a modern, individualistic hero than it is like Homer&#146;s <em>Iliad</em>.\\nIt is a spiritual adventure, a story of self-realization, the discovery of the meaning of\\nthe personality, of a type that would never change down the four-thousand-year-long\\nhistory of human imagination. Its figures have the cogency of symbols that will never\\nalter. It is modern because it is like a dream of a modern man. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gilgamesh is not a demigod. In spite of his divine ancestry and the concern of the gods\\nof Mesopotamia with his adventures, in spite of those adventures&#146; wondrous character,\\nhe remains as secular as Stephen Dedalus. True, critics have taken the twelve tablets, or\\nchapters, of the Assyrian story as standing for the twelve houses of the Zodiac and\\nGilgamesh as the sun moving through the drama of the year. May be; but this is a symbolic\\nsubstructure as remote from the human problems of Gilgamesh as the identical substructure\\nis from the adventures of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce&#146;s <em>Ulysses</em>. It would\\nbe possible to develop a convincing argument that <em>Tom Jones</em> is a sun myth; such\\nsymbolic patterns seem to be determinants of the imagination. What is important about\\nGilgamesh is that, like Tom Jones, he is a man. </p>\\n\\n<p>As King of Uruk, Gilgamesh has too much power for the good of his community. He\\ndeflowers the virgins, consumes the young men in war, works the elders to death building\\nthe city walls. The people appeal to the gods, who make him a companion of clay, the wild\\nman Enkidu, as a foil for his energy. Enkidu is tamed and brought to the city by a temple\\nprostitute. As Gilgamesh comes in the night to claim the <em>droit du seigneur</em> from a\\nnew-wedded bride, Enkidu grapples with him and they fight a mighty battle. Enkidu at last\\nis thrown; whereupon he and Gilgamesh embrace and swear eternal friendship. They set off\\nfor the Land of Cedars to bring back the great trees guarded by the fearful giant Humbaba.\\nThey are protected by the prayers of Gilgamesh&#146;s mother, the priestess-goddess\\nNinsun; watched over by Shamash, the sun god; and aided by the storm winds to defeat\\nHumbaba. When they return to Uruk in victory, the goddess Ishtar falls in love with\\nGilgamesh and offers herself to him. He rejects and insults her. She appeals to the gods\\nfor vengeance. Her father sends down the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh. The\\ncompanions kill the Bull, cut out his heart, and offer it to Shamash, the sun god, and\\nEnkidu throws the thigh of the Bull in the face of Ishtar. The gods in council decide that\\none of the two heroes must die &#151; more for killing the Bull of Heaven and Humbaba and\\ncutting the sacred cedars than for insulting Ishtar. They smite Enkidu with a fatal\\ndisease. Enkidu&#146;s death and Gilgamesh&#146;s lament over his body are the finest\\npoetry of the whole story. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gilgamesh sets off across the world in quest of immortality. Eventually he comes to\\nUtnapishtim, the survivor of the Deluge, far away in the Western Ocean in the Garden of\\nthe Sun. Utnapishtim says that with the exception of himself, the gods have kept immortal\\nlife for themselves and allotted death to man. He tells Gilgamesh the story of the Deluge,\\na narrative that has many points in common with the later tale of Noah. Then he\\ndemonstrates that Gilgamesh cannot hold off sleep, much less death. However, Utnapishtim\\nshows him how to find an underwater plant that will restore youth. Gilgamesh dives down\\nand gets the plant, but loses it to a serpent on his way home. </p>\\n\\n<p>At last he comes back to Uruk and realizes that the mighty walls, the temples, and the\\ngardens that he had built are all the immortality he will ever know. And so he dies, and\\nthe citizens bury him with many offerings, and mourn his death. In the twentieth century,\\narcheologists find the remnants of the walls of Gilgamesh&#146;s Uruk still enduring, and\\nthe &#147;Gilgamesh motif,&#148; a man throttling two beasts, far away in time and place,\\non Anglo-Saxon jewelry at Sutton Hoo, above the North Sea. </p>\\n\\n<p>One reason why <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> still has great power to move us is a\\npoetic style that does not depend on elements like rhyme or meter but on rhetorical\\ndevices, parallelism and antithesis, and the antiphonal organization of short and long\\nphrases, all of which are translatable and which are worked into emotive patterns in the\\noriginals with consummate skill. These are characteristics <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>\\nshares with much Near Eastern poetry, notably with the <em>Psalms</em>, <em>The Song of\\nSongs</em>, the great Canticles of the Old Testament, the Song of Deborah in the book of <em>Judges</em>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This solemn style, like the words of some great ritual, is the direct embodiment of a\\nvision and judgment of the human condition that is permanent and universal. The absurdity\\nof life and death, heroic wistfulness, nostalgia for lost possibilities, melancholy of\\nmissed perfection were as meaningful five thousand years ago to the Sumerians as they are\\nto us. We look at them today in museum cases &#151; round heads, curly hair, immense eyes\\nand noses, plump hands folded over plump chests, cloaks like leaves or feathers &#151; and\\nthey look out at us, and we know that they knew that the love of comrades cannot prevail\\nagainst the insult of death, that erotic women destroy men with impossible demands, that\\nnothing endures, that the memory of heroic action lasts a little while and sometimes the\\nwalls of empire a little longer, that the meaning of life can be revealed but never\\nexplained, and that the realization of these truths constitutes the achievement of true\\npersonality. From the first narrative in the world&#146;s literature Gilgamesh emerges as\\nthe first conscious self. In the course of four thousand years of fiction,\\nself-consciousness will be achieved in many different and more elaborate ways, but it will\\nin fact and essence vary not at all. </p>\\n\\n<p align=\"center\">* * * </p>\\n\\n<p>Since the discovery of the Assyrian tablets in the last century there have been several\\nEnglish versions of <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>. The best is the one by N.K. Sandars in\\nthe Penguin Classics. It is in natural English, devoid of false archaisms; all the known\\ntexts have been woven into the narrative with taste and skill; and the fifty pages of\\nintroduction are as helpful and informative as could be desired. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h1 align=\"center\"><a name=\"Homer, The Iliad\">Homer, <em>The Iliad</em></a> </h1>\\n\\n<p><br>\\nThe best-qualified critics have always agreed that the first work of Western European\\nliterature has remained incomparably the greatest. In itself this is a revelation of the\\nnature of the human mind and of the role of works of art. This is a popular judgment as\\nwell as a critical one. Today, over twenty-five centuries old, Homer competes successfully\\nwith current best sellers and detective stories and the most sensational and topical\\nnonfiction. </p>\\n\\n<p>Modern Americans may be the heirs of Western Civilization, but all the elements of that\\ncivilization have changed drastically since Homer&#146;s day. The office worker who reads\\nHomer on the subway on the way to work bears little superficial resemblance to either\\nHomer&#146;s characters or his audience. Why should two long poems about the life of\\nbarbaric Greece have so great an appeal? </p>\\n\\n<p>It was the fashion in the nineteenth century to deny the existence of Homer and to\\nbreak up <em>The Odyssey</em> and <em>The Iliad</em> into collections of folk ballads.\\nNothing disproves those theories more than this public reception. <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The\\nOdyssey</em> have been read by such a vast diversity of men because they are unitary works\\nof art and deal with universal experience with unsurpassed depth, breadth, and intensity.\\nEach poem shows the powerful insight and organization that come from the artistic craft of\\na complete person. </p>\\n\\n<p>Men have argued about <em>The Iliad</em> for so long and raised so many side issues\\nthat it is easy for a critic to forget that it is formally a tragedy, saturated with a\\ntragic sense of life and constructed with the inevitability of the tragedy of Orestes or\\nMacbeth. It is a double tragedy &#151; of Achilles and the Greeks and of Hector and the\\nTrojans, each reinforcing the other. To modern taste, the heroes are not the Greeks, who\\nare portrayed as quarreling members of a warrior band, but the Trojans, men of family\\nunited in the community of the city-state. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer, like most later writers of epic, Teutonic, Irish, or Icelandic, portrays heroic\\nvalor as fundamentally destructive, not just of social order, but of humane community. The\\nGreeks are doomed by their characteristic virtues. Achilles sulks in his tent; Agamemnon\\nhas stolen his girl. The Greek camp is beset with a disorder that wastes all good things.\\nUnderlying disorder is violence. Violence is not approved of in itself by the Greeks, but\\nall the values that they most admire &#151; the nobility, pride and power, glamour and\\nstrength of barbaric chieftains &#151; flourish only in the context of violence and must\\nbe fed by it continuously. Failure of these values provokes shame, the opposite of the\\nassumption of responsibility, and shame provokes disaster. </p>\\n\\n<p>On the other side of the wall, the Trojans go their orderly and dignified ways. None of\\nthem approves of the crime of Paris, but he is a member of the family of the King of Troy,\\nand the citizens of Troy are members one of another. So they assume his guilt in an act of\\ncollective responsibility. When the Greeks arrived before the walls of Troy, the Trojans\\ncould have thrown Paris and Helen out of the city. The invaders would have gone their way.\\nWhen <em>The Iliad</em> opens, the Greeks have been fighting for ten years and are worn\\nout with the moral attrition of war, while the Trojans have grown ever closer together in\\nthe consciousness of doom. &#147;Our lot is best, to fight for our country,&#148; says\\nHector; and Homer implies a contrast with the Greeks, who are fighting for themselves,\\neach for his own valor and pride. </p>\\n\\n<p>Greeks and Trojans are not the only protagonists of this tragedy. There is another\\ncommunity &#151; the gods of Olympus. In the vast literature of Homeric criticism, I have\\nnever read a mention of what kind of community this was, of where in Homer&#146;s day he\\ncould have found an earthly parallel to such a group of people. The court of Zeus is\\nprecisely a court, like those to be found in the great empires of the ancient Near East\\n&#151; in Egypt, Babylon, or Persia. After Homer, for a few hundred years, Greek society\\nstrove to rise above the tyrant and the court of the tyrant. The Greeks of the Classical\\nperiod looked on the rulers of Persia or Egypt and their provincial imitators in the Greek\\nworld as at once frivolous and dangerous, because, in Greek opinion, they were motivated\\nnot by the moral consensus of a responsible community, but by the whims of what today we\\nwould call a collection of celebrities. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer contrasts the societies of the Greeks, the Trojans, and the Olympian gods as the\\nthree forms of political association that prevailed in the Heroic Age (a time that in\\nfact, four hundred years before, must have seemed almost as remote to him as his age does\\nto us): the barbaric war band; the ancient, Bronze Age, pre-Greek city-state; and the\\nimperial court. He also contrasts men and gods as two disparate orders of being. The gods\\nmay behave like painted and perfumed courtiers of the Persian King of Kings, but they\\nfunction also as conceptual forms of the forces of nature and of the forces that operate\\nwithin the human personality on nonhuman levels. In this role, too, the tragedy of <em>The\\nIliad</em> reveals them as frivolous, dangerous, and unpredictable. </p>\\n\\n<p>True, Homer speaks worshipfully at times of the gods, and especially of Zeus &#151; but\\nin terms of standardized flattery, empty of moral content. Utterly unlike that of the Jew\\nor Muslim or Christian, Homer&#146;s view of the supernatural is devoid of value\\naltogether. Value arises only in the relations of men. He contrasts two different systems\\nof relationships: the epic chivalry of the Heroic Age war band of the Greeks, and the\\nTrojan community of mutual respect and responsibility. The conflicts and resolutions and\\ntragedies that beset the interactions of these human beings are all the good and evil\\nthere is to be found in <em>The Iliad</em>. The gods contribute only chance, fate, doom\\n&#151; as amoral as so many roulette wheels. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer has been read for almost three thousand years, and is read today by millions,\\nbecause he portrayed men in the night-bound world of insensate circumstance, as being each\\nman to his fellow the only light there is, and all men to one another &#151; as the source\\nof the only principle of order. This, says Homer, is the human condition. Out of it in <em>The\\nIliad</em> he constructed a dramatic architecture of a cogency never to be surpassed. </p>\\n\\n<p>Each time I put down <em>The Iliad</em>, after reading it again in some new\\ntranslation, or after reading once more the somber splendor of the Greek, I am convinced,\\nas one is convinced by the experiences of a lifetime, that somehow, in a way beyond the\\nvisions of artistry, I have been face to face with the meaning of existence. Other works\\nof literature give this insight, but none so powerfully, so uncontaminated by evasion or\\nsubterfuge. If the art of poetry is a symbolic criticism of value, <em>The Iliad</em> is\\nthe paramount classic of that art. Its purity, simplicity, definition, and impact reveal\\nlife and expose it to irrevocable judgment, with finality and at the beginning of European\\nliterature. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h1 align=\"center\"><a name=\"Homer, The Odyssey\">Homer, <em>The Odyssey</em></a> </h1>\\n\\n<p><br>\\nIn all the melee on the Trojan plain, there is one person who always takes the\\ncommon-sense point of view. He is cunning, prudent, imperturbable. He always seeks the\\ngreatest return for the least expenditure of blood or spirit. This is Odysseus. Amongst\\nthe Levantine Trojans and the Viking-like Greeks, caught up in the irrationality of\\ncircumstance and broken against their own contradictions, he seems an intruder from\\nanother time. And so he is. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Iliad</em> is a symphonic work of art. The double theme with its intense\\npolarity is modulated, retarded, and quickened, yet moves relentlessly to climax and\\nrecapitulation. The only devices in <em>The Odyssey</em> are flashbacks in time, the\\nnarratives within the narrative. They complicate the structure; they do not compound it.\\nThe episode with Nausikaa is self-sufficient and is written with such poignancy and\\nclarity that it led Samuel Butler to &#147;prove&#148; that <em>The Odyssey</em> was\\nwritten by Nausikaa herself. </p>\\n\\n<p>Only a few stories of the various Heroic Ages, those we think of as preeminently epic,\\nare concerned with the working out of an inexorable doom, the consequence of sin, folly,\\nand flaws of character in the protagonists. These few are tragedies &#151; the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>;\\nseveral Icelandic sagas, but especially <em>Burnt Njal</em>; the tale of Tristram and\\nIseult; the story of Arthur, Launcelot, and Guinevere; and the Irish Cuchulain cycle. </p>\\n\\n<p>Epics like <em>The Ramayana</em>, <em>Gilgamesh</em>, the story of the Holy Grail are\\nquests. Others are adventure stories like <em>Sinbad the Sailor</em>. When the latter\\npossess a dramatic structure, it is of the sort we would call comic. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is a collection of adventures, of little melodramas like the\\nearliest English and Scots Ballads, and of folktales like those in Grimm. The supernatural\\nappears not from Olympus, but on the level of fairy stories and superstitions. In\\ncontrast, there is nothing folkloristic about <em>The Iliad</em>. Its legendary materials\\nare myths. <em>The Iliad</em> never falters in its vision of the gods as personifications\\nof nonhuman forces herding men to their doom. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, Poseidon is only\\nthe unruly and unpredictable sea; Athena, the virtues of Odysseus himself projected on the\\nheavens. </p>\\n\\n<p>The virtues of Odysseus are not those of a warrior, but those of a merchant-adventurer\\nwho has wandered the ancient seas from Gibraltar to the Crimea and the Caucasus and has\\nsurvived and profited: agility, inventiveness, courage, prudence, and persistence. They\\ninclude neither heroic valor nor civic duty. Odysseus knows neither shame nor guilt. </p>\\n\\n<p>In <em>The Odyssey</em>, man is a part of nature. He can outwit nature, learn its\\nsecrets, use it. Its personifications are less than human and succumb to human wisdom or\\ncunning. The heroes of <em>The Iliad</em> are shaken and thwarted in their courses by vast\\npowers. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, men are continually tricked and tempted by <em>daimons</em>,\\nby malicious spirits, or by &#147;some god.&#148; Odysseus blames a malicious devil when\\nhe forgets to wear his cloak on a chilly night. The enchantresses of <em>The Odyssey</em>\\nare not archetypes of the grandeur, misery, and enervation of lust like Helen. They are\\nwitches; above all, they are the extravagantly satisfying whores that sailors wander the\\nsurface of the planet seeking to this day. Even Nausikaa bears an uncanny resemblance to\\nthat good girl the old bo&#146;sun met once in his far-off youth when he wandered into a\\nchurch social and who took him home to meet the folks. </p>\\n\\n<p>It is home that haunts <em>The Odyssey</em>, as it has haunted men in\\nfo&#146;c&#146;sles before and since. Although, like all sailors, Odysseus thinks he wants\\nto get home, again like all sailors, he spends an inordinate time doing it. The keystone\\nlines in <em>The Odyssey</em> which compare with Hector&#146;s last interview with his\\nwife and child, or Achilles&#146; with Priam, are in praise of marriage, yet they sound\\nsuspiciously ironic. </p>\\n\\n<p>The adventures of <em>The Odyssey</em> are fantastic, but their denouement is pure\\nfantasy. Odysseus&#146; return and slaughter of the suitors is the most outlandish thing\\nin Greek literature. No custom like it is known in the mercantile Levant of Homer&#146;s\\ntime, nor in the similar societies of the South Seas in the recent past. We have no reason\\nto believe that a wife whose husband had abandoned her for twenty years would remain\\nfaithful, that she would be persecuted by a mob of suitors who would move into her home\\nand struggle with one another for her hand and consume her substance. Nor has there ever\\nbeen any legal code or custom that would justify the husband in mercilessly slaughtering\\nthem all when he showed up incognito after twenty years. </p>\\n\\n<p>Something the story does resemble: the ever-recurring dream in the barren hotel rooms,\\ncrowded barracks, and fo&#146;c&#146;sles of traveling men, soldiers and sailors, long\\naway. &#147;Is my wife true to me? What is she doing now? Do they think of me at home?\\nWill my son recognize me when I get back? Are those fellows still pestering my wife? Has\\nshe given in to them? Do they hang around the house? Wait till I get back; I&#146;ll fix\\nthem.&#148; As dream and daydream, the climax of <em>The Odyssey</em> has been a universal\\nexperience of wandering husbands; as fact, it has not existed. Any seafaring society with\\nsuch a custom would have exterminated itself. </p>\\n\\n<p>All <em>The Odyssey</em> has a character of dream unlike the stark objectivity of <em>The\\nIliad</em>. The events of <em>The Iliad</em> follow one another, bright, swift, sure, and\\ndramatically necessary. The events of <em>The Odyssey</em> fade and dissolve; the\\nnarrative wanders in time; the pictures are brilliant, but they glitter through a mist of\\nreverie &#151; an old sailor musing over the glamour of his past. The texture of the verse\\nis light in <em>The Odyssey</em>; the imagery sparkles; but it never loses both its\\ndecorative delicacy of detail and its melancholy tone. <em>The Iliad</em> is full of the\\nthunder and lightning of the king of gods and men. When there is thunder in <em>The\\nOdyssey</em>, it is that of some foolish one-eyed giant whose fellows laugh at him. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is entertainment. It is entertainment of the highest order, but it\\nis difficult to imagine anyone saying, &#147;Reading <em>The Odyssey</em> changed my life\\nfundamentally.&#148; <em>The Iliad</em> can be read only superficially as entertainment.\\nIf we make ourselves available to it, it confronts us with a vision of the nature of\\nreality and the being of man. <em>The Iliad</em> says: &#147;This is life. It is tragic,\\nand if it has meaning, that meaning is an incommunicable mystery; it can be presented, but\\nnever explained.&#148; <em>The Odyssey</em> says: &#147;This is life. It is comic, and it\\nis full of meanings. These meanings are all the multiform techniques for living; they can\\nbe learned by work, intelligence, and a canny conscience.&#148; </p>\\n\\n<p>Tragedy is a posture; comedy is an activity. If one read enough comedies, they might\\nchange one&#146;s life fundamentally. Life as comedy can be learned; as tragedy it can\\nonly be assumed. Most men are predominantly one type or the other; an individual&#146;s\\nview of life is seldom equally balanced between tragedy and comedy. However, the dramatic\\nartists of the world&#146;s literature have usually written both; they have realized that\\nthere are two faces of the coin of life: on one side, the head of an implacable and\\nbeautiful god; on the other, a curious animal. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>Selections from Kenneth Rexroth&#146;s <em>Classics Revisited</em> (copyright 1968\\nKenneth Rexroth) and <em>More Classics Revisited</em> (copyright 1989 Kenneth Rexroth\\nTrust).

This implies that we should look at this period as the ideal example for family relationships, practices, and attitudes which we should emulate. There is a lesson to be learned from each aspect of this relationship, starting with the circumstances surrounding its onset, followed by the numerous, happy and sad incidents known to us that filled this period of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)\\'s life. For the purpose of brevity , only a few specific observations will be discussed. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Circumstances </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The first observation is related to the circumstances surrounding the onset of this marriage. The age of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) was 25 years, which is probably the optimal age of marriage for a man. Khadijah(R.A.) was 40 years old at that time. It this point should mean anything, it is to show that the traditional expectation that the wife\\'s age should be close to, or slightly less than the husband\\'s is not necessarily true all the time. What counts actually is not the age, but the maturity and compatibility. Another point of this observation is the fact that the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) was independent, gainfully employed, and very successful. His efficient work performance and excellent business ability were actually one the main reasons Khadijah(R.A.) was attracted to him. Although Khadijah(R.A.) was wealthy and able to support the household, the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) continued to work and produce. This is another pointer for our husbands-to-be, that he is able to provide for the family. A third point is the fact that Khadijah(R.A.) was the one who approached the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) regarding the marriage through her friend, Nafeesah. Many of the Muslims feel that it is not appropriate for a girl or her guardian to approach a man regarding marriage, and that the man is the one who should ask for the girl\\'s hand. The example of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)\\'s marriage to Khadijah(R.A.) shows that such a tradition is just a matter of false pride. It is quite appropriate for a female seeking marriage, or for her guardian, to approach a qualified candidate regarding marriage, as long as this is done in a decent, proper way. It should actually be the duty of the parents to look for the proper righteous husbands for their daughters, since these righteous husbands are usually difficult to find these days. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Another observation is related to the type of relation and attitude between Muhammad (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) and Khadijah(R.A.). This family relationship was charac- terized by love, respect, and appreciation; by hard work, support, and cooperation; and above all, by unprecedented loyalty that lasted till the end of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)\\'s life, even after the death of Khadijah(R.A.). How did the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) achieve such a beautiful relationship? </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>The Prophet</B><B>(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)</B><B>\\'s Character </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">One clue to this beautiful relationship was the beautiful standard of character of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) himself. When Ayeshah(R.A.) was asked about the character of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam), she answered: `His character was the Qur\\'an; whatever upset Allah, upset him; and whatever pleased Allah, pleased him; and after Allah had perfected his character, He praised him by saying in the Qur\\'an: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;And verily, you have an exalted standard of character...&quot; (Qur\\'an 68:4) </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">It was the consensus of all those who knew the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) that he was gentle and kind; generous and noble; thoughtful and considerate; honest and sincere; loyal and trustworthy. He liked the good and disliked the evil. He had a sense of humour without excess; he joked but always spoke the truth; he was simple but firm; he was humble though he had great wisdom and knowledge; he was an example of morality; and he was a mercy to anyone who got in touch with him. True was Allah\\'s description of him: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;We sent you not but as a mercy for all creatures ...&quot; (21:107) </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Anyone who saw him, respected him. And anyone who got to know him, loved him. With all the beautiful features listed above, it is no wonder that he won the heart of Khadijah(R.A.) as he won the hearts of all his followers and companions. The Qur\\'an teaches us that goodness would convert enemy to friend: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;Nor can Goodness and Evil be equal. Repel (evil) with what is better, then the one who was your enemy becomes as he were your best friend and intimate...&quot; (Surah 41:34) </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">If goodness can make a friend out of an enemy, it can definitely increase and strengthen the ties with a love one. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Mutual Support and Counseling </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">This simple but true fact is commonly ignored by many marriage partners. They take the relationship between them for granted. They may express their kind feelings to outsiders and show their best behaviour to strangers, but when they deal with each other, each assumes that the other already knows his or her feelings. They take each other\\'s feelings for granted. If each partner shows the best of himself or herself to his/her partner, many shaky marriages will become healthy and successful again. Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) gave us the best example in this respect. He always showed his best side to his family. He always asked the believers to be good to their families, and when it comes to good deeds, own should start with those he is in charge of. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Another clue to the realization of an ideal family relationship such as the one which existed between the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) and his wife, Khadijah(R.A.), was the mutual counseling and support. A single incident will be quoted to make a point. I was the time when the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) received the first revelation. The magnitude and the impact of this incident was so great that it literally shook him up. Whom did he go to for counsel and support in such a difficult time? Did he go this best friend? Or to his lawyer? Or to his professor or advisor? Or to the elder of the community or tribe? None of these. He went to his wife Khadijah. He asked her for support and for her opinion, and apparently he knew what he was doing. She responded in the most appropriate manner. She did not faint or panic. She ated in the most comforting and supportive way, and filled him with confidence. She was quoted to say: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;Be steadfast and have good news. By the one who has Khadijah(R.A.)\\'s soul in His hand, I wish you become the Prophet of the this nation. By God, God will never let you down. You are kind to the kin, you are truthful in your word, you carry the weak, you host your guest, and you support the afflicted.&quot; </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Someone may ask: what would this single incident mean? It means quite a lot. This type of mutual trust and confidence does not develop instantly. It is rather the result of long years of exposure, testing and practice. In such a challenging and difficult situation, the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) would not seek counsel and support from someone he had not trusted and tried before. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The point to be made is that the mutual counseling and support between marriage partners is an essential ingredient for a successful family life. IT serves two purposes: One is that a very useful source of counsel and support must be utilized rather than wasted. Second, the consulted partner will develop confidence, in addition to a sense of participation and appreciation, which will further strengthen family ties. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Helping Around the House </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Another clue was the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)\\'s participation in the activities of his family, giving a helping hand whenever he could. When Ayeshah was asked: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;What did the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) do at home?&quot; She replied: &quot;He would be involved in the service of his family, and when the time for prayers was due, he would wash up and go out for prayers.&quot; </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Unfortunately, may men feel that it is beneath their dignity to participate in housework. It is true that the home and housekeeping are usually the domain and responsibility of the wife, but a helping hand by a husband can be of great value. On the one hand, it will help the husband to undertstand and appreciate the duties and problems of his wife. On the other hand, it will signal to the wife his interest and caring attitude. Besides, his behaviour will be an example to the children, who might feel that housework is for mothers only. Sometimes the services of the husband are not needed, or not feasible. Here, gestures of goodwill and willingness to help are all that is needed. At other times, his service at home may be badly needed. In such a case, any time he can spare to serve his family is time well-spent. Of course, the service provided could be physical, spiritual, or intellectual. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Respect for the family </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Another clue was the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)\\'s respect for his family. Ayeshah(R.A.) said: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;The Messenger(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) of Allah has never beaten a wife or a servant, and he has never hit anything with his hand except when fighting in the cause of Allah.&quot; </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Although physical discipline may be required or justified in a crisis and when dealing with immature individuals where reason and logic are of no value, the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) always discouraged this mode of action. The normal treatment of mature individuals should be based mainly on logic, reason and sound understanding. The main miracle of Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) is the Qur\\'an, which is a message to the minds of all people. IT is the Islamic approach to utilize mainly the mind and reasoning rather than to paralyze and overpower the person by physical means. When it comes to corrective action, a serious word or look or gesture could be more effective and even more painful than beating with a whip. Physical means are saved for the ones who do not have enough mind to understand. When beating has to be used along these lines, the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) teaches us that one should not hurt and that one should avoid the face. The Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam), however, gives us a marvelous reminder: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;The best among you do not beat.&quot; </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">There is indeed a great message in this short statement. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Stability in Face of Hardships </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Another clue to the successful marriage was the stability and good faith of the partners when facing difficulties and afflictions. Many husbands and wives are taken by frustration and despair when they face difficult problems. Some lose control and completely break down. Many families fall apart after loss of money, failure of business, or any other type of trauma. The Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) and his wife faced a great many difficulties, including the loss of children (especially the loss of boys in a society which used to kill female infants out of shame). In addition, they suffered the rejection and persecution inflicted on them by their own people. Their response did not consist in breaking down, or giving up. These difficulties probably increased their determination to build up their efforts to cope with difficulties. This clue should be a good lesson for all marriage partners who are shaken by the least of tremors in their family life. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Loyalty </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Another feature of the relationship between Prophet Muhammad(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) and his wife Khadijah(R.A.), was his unprecedented loyalty to her. Loyalty is actually a cause and a result of the ideal marital relationship which existed between them. Loyalty is not just the lack of cheating, or lack of having extra-marital relations. Loyalty can be an on-going positive attitude which can be expressed in many actions, words or gestures. The resultant strenghthening of personal relations between the partners will in turn increase their loyalty towards one another. Prophet Muhammad(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) remained loyal to Khadijah(R.A.) to the end of his life, long after her death. Ayeshah used to say that she was not jealous of any woman more than Khadijah(R.A.), although Khadijah(R.A.) was already dead, because the Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) always had the best memories of her. The Prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) also had a special kind of feeling towards anyone Khadijah used to like. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"3\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Hard Work, Together for the Sake of Allah </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">One more feature of the happy marriage to Khadijah(R.A.) was that it was not a restful and easy-going one. Besides love and affection, there was a great deal of struggle and hard work to spread the message of Islam. When the Prophet (pbuh) received the second revelation: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;O you wrapped up. Arise and deliver thy warning...&quot; (Surah 74, 1-2) </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">which woke him from his sleep, breathing heavily and sweating profusely, his wife Khadijah(R.A.) approached him gently to go back to bed and have some sleep and rest. His answer was: </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">&quot;O Khadijah, the time for sleep and rest is over. Jibril(A.S.) has commanded me to warn the people and call them to Allah and His worship. Whom should I call? And who is going to respond to me?&quot; </FONT></div>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Khadijah comforted him and anxiously declared her Islam and her acceptance of the prophethood of her husband. From then on, it was like a Da\\'wah team, striving together in the cause of Allah. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">This lesson is for every family, where one partner is upset and concerned because the other partner has to work hard in the cause of Allah. It would make things a lot easier if both partners did this work together and started their won Da\\'wah team. Part of the Da\\'wah work will naturally go towards their won personal education and the teaching of their children. By doing it this way, the frustration will subside, and the joy and pleasure will grow. </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The above listed aspects and many more, all contributed to the development of the beautiful relationship between Prophet Muhammad (sallallahu alaiyhi assallam) and his wife Khadijah(R.A.). </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">The marriage to Khadijah(R.A.) was a &quot;one wife marriage&quot;. For 25 years of the Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi assallam)\\'s prime age and in a time and place where unlimited polygamy was quite acceptable, and until the death of Khadijah(R.A.), it remained a monogamous marriage. Could it be that Divine wisdom wanted this aspect to be one of the features of this &quot;model marriage&quot; for all of us to emulate under normal circumstances? </FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#0000FF\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Courtesy: &nbsp;www.everymuslim.com</B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<bR>\\r\\n<DIV ALIGN=\"LEFT\"></DIV>\\r\\n<div style=\"text-align:CENTER; \">\\r\\n                <TABLE BORDER=\"3\" CELLPADDING=\"2\" CELLSPACING=\"1\" WIDTH=\"587\" BORDERCOLORLIGHT=\"#336600\" BORDERCOLORDARK=\"#336600\" FRAME=\"BOX\" RULES=\"ALL\" ALIGN=\"BOTTOM\" HSPACE=\"0\" VSPACE=\"0\" BGCOLOR=#FFFFCC\\r\\n>\\r\\n                    <tR>\\r\\n                        <tD  VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=2 HEIGHT= 16 ><NOBR><div style=\"text-align:CENTER; \"><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#993366\" FACE=\"Times New Roman\"><A HREF=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/contentstable/index.htm\" TARGET=\"_top\"    TITLE=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/c\"><U><B>Home</B></U></A><B> &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;</B><A HREF=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/contentstable/id16.htm\" TARGET=\"_top\"    TITLE=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/c\"><U><B>Advices</B></U></A><B> &nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;</B><B>The Prophet(sallallahu alaiyhi wasallam\\'s) marriage to Khadija(R.A.)</B></FONT></div>\\r\\n</NOBR></tD>\\r\\n</tR>\\r\\n                    <tR>\\r\\n                        <tD  VALIGN=TOP HEIGHT= 53 ><NOBR><div><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#993366\" FACE=\"Times New Roman\"><FONT  FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" COLOR=\"#000000\" SIZE= 3 ><A HREF=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/contentstable/index.htm\" TARGET=\"_top\"    TITLE=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/c\"><U><IMG SRC=\"04342350.gif\" border=0 width=\"66\" height=\"53\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\" HSPACE=\"0\" VSPACE=\"0\"></U></A></FONT><A HREF=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/contentstable/index.htm\" TARGET=\"_top\"    TITLE=\"https://members.tripod.com/worldupdates/c\"><U><B>Home</B></U></A><B> </B></FONT></div>\\r\\n</NOBR></tD>\\r\\n                        <tD  VALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=\"424\"><div style=\"text-align:CENTER; \"><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#336600\" FACE=\"Times New Roman\"><A HREF=\"https://members.tripod.com/bin/email_this_page/display_form\" TARGET=\"_top\"    TITLE=\"https://members.tripod.com/bin/email_this\"><U><B>E-mail this page to a friend</B></U></A></FONT></div>\\r\\n</tD>\\r\\n</tR>\\r\\n</TABLE></div>\\r\\n<div><IMG BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"1x1.gif\" HEIGHT=\"1\" ALIGN=\"bottom\" WIDTH=\"1\" HSPACE=\"0\" VSPACE=\"0\"\\r\\n></div>\\r\\n<div style=\"text-align:CENTER; \"><FONT SIZE=\"1\" COLOR=\"#663399\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><B>Annoyed with Banners &amp; Adverts: REMOVE them permanently from your web Browser.</B></FONT></div>\\r\\n<div style=\"text-align:CENTER; \"><FONT SIZE=\"2\" COLOR=\"#663399\" FACE=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><FONT  SIZE= 1 ><B>DOWNLOAD </B></FONT><A HREF=\"http://adext.magenet.net/install.php\" TARGET=\"_top\"    TITLE=\"http://adext.magenet.net/install.php\"><U><B>AD EXTINGUISHER</B></U></A><B>(112 kb) </B><FONT  SIZE= 1 ><B>FOR FREE.</B></FONT></FONT></div>\\r\\n</Td>\\r\\n<Td ALIGN=\"LEFT\" WIDTH=\"12\" VALIGN = \"top\" ><IMG BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"1x1.gif\" HEIGHT=\"1\" ALIGN=\"bottom\" WIDTH=\"12\" HSPACE=\"0\" VSPACE=\"0\"></Td>\\r\\n </Tr>\\r\\n <Tr>\\r\\n  <Td WIDTH=\"12\" HEIGHT=\"1\"></Td>  <Td><FONT SIZE=\"1\"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</FONT></Td>  <Td WIDTH=\"12\" ></Td>\\r\\n </Tr>\\r\\n</TABLE>\\r\\n</BODY>\\r\\n</HTML>']]\n",
