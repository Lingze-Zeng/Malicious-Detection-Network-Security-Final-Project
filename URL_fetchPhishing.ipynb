Gilgamesh was the\\nfifth king of the Sumerian city of Uruk after the Great Flood. Under his rule, about 2500\\nBC, Uruk conquered the surrounding city-states and established something like a small\\nnation. For two thousand years Gilgamesh survived in the Near East as an epic hero. There\\nare versions of his story in Hittite, Hurrian, Canaanite, Sumerian, and Assyrian, and the\\ndim memory of his fame in the Koran. The most complete text comes from Assurbanipal&#146;s\\nlibrary, formed just before the destruction of Nineveh in the seventh century BC. The\\nstory seems to have taken form almost two thousand years before that. Considering the\\ndisparity of cultures and languages, the great stretch of time, the means of reproduction\\nand communication, <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is one of the most popular stories ever\\ntold. </p>\\n\\n<p>Rightly so. It may be the first, but it is a highly developed fictional narrative. It\\nis not a myth. Even to call it an epic requires a stretching of the definition. It is more\\nlike a novel of a modern, individualistic hero than it is like Homer&#146;s <em>Iliad</em>.\\nIt is a spiritual adventure, a story of self-realization, the discovery of the meaning of\\nthe personality, of a type that would never change down the four-thousand-year-long\\nhistory of human imagination. Its figures have the cogency of symbols that will never\\nalter. It is modern because it is like a dream of a modern man. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gilgamesh is not a demigod. In spite of his divine ancestry and the concern of the gods\\nof Mesopotamia with his adventures, in spite of those adventures&#146; wondrous character,\\nhe remains as secular as Stephen Dedalus. True, critics have taken the twelve tablets, or\\nchapters, of the Assyrian story as standing for the twelve houses of the Zodiac and\\nGilgamesh as the sun moving through the drama of the year. May be; but this is a symbolic\\nsubstructure as remote from the human problems of Gilgamesh as the identical substructure\\nis from the adventures of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce&#146;s <em>Ulysses</em>. It would\\nbe possible to develop a convincing argument that <em>Tom Jones</em> is a sun myth; such\\nsymbolic patterns seem to be determinants of the imagination. What is important about\\nGilgamesh is that, like Tom Jones, he is a man. </p>\\n\\n<p>As King of Uruk, Gilgamesh has too much power for the good of his community. He\\ndeflowers the virgins, consumes the young men in war, works the elders to death building\\nthe city walls. The people appeal to the gods, who make him a companion of clay, the wild\\nman Enkidu, as a foil for his energy. Enkidu is tamed and brought to the city by a temple\\nprostitute. As Gilgamesh comes in the night to claim the <em>droit du seigneur</em> from a\\nnew-wedded bride, Enkidu grapples with him and they fight a mighty battle. Enkidu at last\\nis thrown; whereupon he and Gilgamesh embrace and swear eternal friendship. They set off\\nfor the Land of Cedars to bring back the great trees guarded by the fearful giant Humbaba.\\nThey are protected by the prayers of Gilgamesh&#146;s mother, the priestess-goddess\\nNinsun; watched over by Shamash, the sun god; and aided by the storm winds to defeat\\nHumbaba. When they return to Uruk in victory, the goddess Ishtar falls in love with\\nGilgamesh and offers herself to him. He rejects and insults her. She appeals to the gods\\nfor vengeance. Her father sends down the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh. The\\ncompanions kill the Bull, cut out his heart, and offer it to Shamash, the sun god, and\\nEnkidu throws the thigh of the Bull in the face of Ishtar. The gods in council decide that\\none of the two heroes must die &#151; more for killing the Bull of Heaven and Humbaba and\\ncutting the sacred cedars than for insulting Ishtar. They smite Enkidu with a fatal\\ndisease. Enkidu&#146;s death and Gilgamesh&#146;s lament over his body are the finest\\npoetry of the whole story. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gilgamesh sets off across the world in quest of immortality. Eventually he comes to\\nUtnapishtim, the survivor of the Deluge, far away in the Western Ocean in the Garden of\\nthe Sun. Utnapishtim says that with the exception of himself, the gods have kept immortal\\nlife for themselves and allotted death to man. He tells Gilgamesh the story of the Deluge,\\na narrative that has many points in common with the later tale of Noah. Then he\\ndemonstrates that Gilgamesh cannot hold off sleep, much less death. However, Utnapishtim\\nshows him how to find an underwater plant that will restore youth. Gilgamesh dives down\\nand gets the plant, but loses it to a serpent on his way home. </p>\\n\\n<p>At last he comes back to Uruk and realizes that the mighty walls, the temples, and the\\ngardens that he had built are all the immortality he will ever know. And so he dies, and\\nthe citizens bury him with many offerings, and mourn his death. In the twentieth century,\\narcheologists find the remnants of the walls of Gilgamesh&#146;s Uruk still enduring, and\\nthe &#147;Gilgamesh motif,&#148; a man throttling two beasts, far away in time and place,\\non Anglo-Saxon jewelry at Sutton Hoo, above the North Sea. </p>\\n\\n<p>One reason why <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> still has great power to move us is a\\npoetic style that does not depend on elements like rhyme or meter but on rhetorical\\ndevices, parallelism and antithesis, and the antiphonal organization of short and long\\nphrases, all of which are translatable and which are worked into emotive patterns in the\\noriginals with consummate skill. These are characteristics <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>\\nshares with much Near Eastern poetry, notably with the <em>Psalms</em>, <em>The Song of\\nSongs</em>, the great Canticles of the Old Testament, the Song of Deborah in the book of <em>Judges</em>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This solemn style, like the words of some great ritual, is the direct embodiment of a\\nvision and judgment of the human condition that is permanent and universal. The absurdity\\nof life and death, heroic wistfulness, nostalgia for lost possibilities, melancholy of\\nmissed perfection were as meaningful five thousand years ago to the Sumerians as they are\\nto us. We look at them today in museum cases &#151; round heads, curly hair, immense eyes\\nand noses, plump hands folded over plump chests, cloaks like leaves or feathers &#151; and\\nthey look out at us, and we know that they knew that the love of comrades cannot prevail\\nagainst the insult of death, that erotic women destroy men with impossible demands, that\\nnothing endures, that the memory of heroic action lasts a little while and sometimes the\\nwalls of empire a little longer, that the meaning of life can be revealed but never\\nexplained, and that the realization of these truths constitutes the achievement of true\\npersonality. From the first narrative in the world&#146;s literature Gilgamesh emerges as\\nthe first conscious self. In the course of four thousand years of fiction,\\nself-consciousness will be achieved in many different and more elaborate ways, but it will\\nin fact and essence vary not at all. </p>\\n\\n<p align=\"center\">* * * </p>\\n\\n<p>Since the discovery of the Assyrian tablets in the last century there have been several\\nEnglish versions of <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>. The best is the one by N.K. Sandars in\\nthe Penguin Classics. It is in natural English, devoid of false archaisms; all the known\\ntexts have been woven into the narrative with taste and skill; and the fifty pages of\\nintroduction are as helpful and informative as could be desired. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h1 align=\"center\"><a name=\"Homer, The Iliad\">Homer, <em>The Iliad</em></a> </h1>\\n\\n<p><br>\\nThe best-qualified critics have always agreed that the first work of Western European\\nliterature has remained incomparably the greatest. In itself this is a revelation of the\\nnature of the human mind and of the role of works of art. This is a popular judgment as\\nwell as a critical one. Today, over twenty-five centuries old, Homer competes successfully\\nwith current best sellers and detective stories and the most sensational and topical\\nnonfiction. </p>\\n\\n<p>Modern Americans may be the heirs of Western Civilization, but all the elements of that\\ncivilization have changed drastically since Homer&#146;s day. The office worker who reads\\nHomer on the subway on the way to work bears little superficial resemblance to either\\nHomer&#146;s characters or his audience. Why should two long poems about the life of\\nbarbaric Greece have so great an appeal? </p>\\n\\n<p>It was the fashion in the nineteenth century to deny the existence of Homer and to\\nbreak up <em>The Odyssey</em> and <em>The Iliad</em> into collections of folk ballads.\\nNothing disproves those theories more than this public reception. <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The\\nOdyssey</em> have been read by such a vast diversity of men because they are unitary works\\nof art and deal with universal experience with unsurpassed depth, breadth, and intensity.\\nEach poem shows the powerful insight and organization that come from the artistic craft of\\na complete person. </p>\\n\\n<p>Men have argued about <em>The Iliad</em> for so long and raised so many side issues\\nthat it is easy for a critic to forget that it is formally a tragedy, saturated with a\\ntragic sense of life and constructed with the inevitability of the tragedy of Orestes or\\nMacbeth. It is a double tragedy &#151; of Achilles and the Greeks and of Hector and the\\nTrojans, each reinforcing the other. To modern taste, the heroes are not the Greeks, who\\nare portrayed as quarreling members of a warrior band, but the Trojans, men of family\\nunited in the community of the city-state. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer, like most later writers of epic, Teutonic, Irish, or Icelandic, portrays heroic\\nvalor as fundamentally destructive, not just of social order, but of humane community. The\\nGreeks are doomed by their characteristic virtues. Achilles sulks in his tent; Agamemnon\\nhas stolen his girl. The Greek camp is beset with a disorder that wastes all good things.\\nUnderlying disorder is violence. Violence is not approved of in itself by the Greeks, but\\nall the values that they most admire &#151; the nobility, pride and power, glamour and\\nstrength of barbaric chieftains &#151; flourish only in the context of violence and must\\nbe fed by it continuously. Failure of these values provokes shame, the opposite of the\\nassumption of responsibility, and shame provokes disaster. </p>\\n\\n<p>On the other side of the wall, the Trojans go their orderly and dignified ways. None of\\nthem approves of the crime of Paris, but he is a member of the family of the King of Troy,\\nand the citizens of Troy are members one of another. So they assume his guilt in an act of\\ncollective responsibility. When the Greeks arrived before the walls of Troy, the Trojans\\ncould have thrown Paris and Helen out of the city. The invaders would have gone their way.\\nWhen <em>The Iliad</em> opens, the Greeks have been fighting for ten years and are worn\\nout with the moral attrition of war, while the Trojans have grown ever closer together in\\nthe consciousness of doom. &#147;Our lot is best, to fight for our country,&#148; says\\nHector; and Homer implies a contrast with the Greeks, who are fighting for themselves,\\neach for his own valor and pride. </p>\\n\\n<p>Greeks and Trojans are not the only protagonists of this tragedy. There is another\\ncommunity &#151; the gods of Olympus. In the vast literature of Homeric criticism, I have\\nnever read a mention of what kind of community this was, of where in Homer&#146;s day he\\ncould have found an earthly parallel to such a group of people. The court of Zeus is\\nprecisely a court, like those to be found in the great empires of the ancient Near East\\n&#151; in Egypt, Babylon, or Persia. After Homer, for a few hundred years, Greek society\\nstrove to rise above the tyrant and the court of the tyrant. The Greeks of the Classical\\nperiod looked on the rulers of Persia or Egypt and their provincial imitators in the Greek\\nworld as at once frivolous and dangerous, because, in Greek opinion, they were motivated\\nnot by the moral consensus of a responsible community, but by the whims of what today we\\nwould call a collection of celebrities. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer contrasts the societies of the Greeks, the Trojans, and the Olympian gods as the\\nthree forms of political association that prevailed in the Heroic Age (a time that in\\nfact, four hundred years before, must have seemed almost as remote to him as his age does\\nto us): the barbaric war band; the ancient, Bronze Age, pre-Greek city-state; and the\\nimperial court. He also contrasts men and gods as two disparate orders of being. The gods\\nmay behave like painted and perfumed courtiers of the Persian King of Kings, but they\\nfunction also as conceptual forms of the forces of nature and of the forces that operate\\nwithin the human personality on nonhuman levels. In this role, too, the tragedy of <em>The\\nIliad</em> reveals them as frivolous, dangerous, and unpredictable. </p>\\n\\n<p>True, Homer speaks worshipfully at times of the gods, and especially of Zeus &#151; but\\nin terms of standardized flattery, empty of moral content. Utterly unlike that of the Jew\\nor Muslim or Christian, Homer&#146;s view of the supernatural is devoid of value\\naltogether. Value arises only in the relations of men. He contrasts two different systems\\nof relationships: the epic chivalry of the Heroic Age war band of the Greeks, and the\\nTrojan community of mutual respect and responsibility. The conflicts and resolutions and\\ntragedies that beset the interactions of these human beings are all the good and evil\\nthere is to be found in <em>The Iliad</em>. The gods contribute only chance, fate, doom\\n&#151; as amoral as so many roulette wheels. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer has been read for almost three thousand years, and is read today by millions,\\nbecause he portrayed men in the night-bound world of insensate circumstance, as being each\\nman to his fellow the only light there is, and all men to one another &#151; as the source\\nof the only principle of order. This, says Homer, is the human condition. Out of it in <em>The\\nIliad</em> he constructed a dramatic architecture of a cogency never to be surpassed. </p>\\n\\n<p>Each time I put down <em>The Iliad</em>, after reading it again in some new\\ntranslation, or after reading once more the somber splendor of the Greek, I am convinced,\\nas one is convinced by the experiences of a lifetime, that somehow, in a way beyond the\\nvisions of artistry, I have been face to face with the meaning of existence. Other works\\nof literature give this insight, but none so powerfully, so uncontaminated by evasion or\\nsubterfuge. If the art of poetry is a symbolic criticism of value, <em>The Iliad</em> is\\nthe paramount classic of that art. Its purity, simplicity, definition, and impact reveal\\nlife and expose it to irrevocable judgment, with finality and at the beginning of European\\nliterature. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h1 align=\"center\"><a name=\"Homer, The Odyssey\">Homer, <em>The Odyssey</em></a> </h1>\\n\\n<p><br>\\nIn all the melee on the Trojan plain, there is one person who always takes the\\ncommon-sense point of view. He is cunning, prudent, imperturbable. He always seeks the\\ngreatest return for the least expenditure of blood or spirit. This is Odysseus. Amongst\\nthe Levantine Trojans and the Viking-like Greeks, caught up in the irrationality of\\ncircumstance and broken against their own contradictions, he seems an intruder from\\nanother time. And so he is. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Iliad</em> is a symphonic work of art. The double theme with its intense\\npolarity is modulated, retarded, and quickened, yet moves relentlessly to climax and\\nrecapitulation. The only devices in <em>The Odyssey</em> are flashbacks in time, the\\nnarratives within the narrative. They complicate the structure; they do not compound it.\\nThe episode with Nausikaa is self-sufficient and is written with such poignancy and\\nclarity that it led Samuel Butler to &#147;prove&#148; that <em>The Odyssey</em> was\\nwritten by Nausikaa herself. </p>\\n\\n<p>Only a few stories of the various Heroic Ages, those we think of as preeminently epic,\\nare concerned with the working out of an inexorable doom, the consequence of sin, folly,\\nand flaws of character in the protagonists. These few are tragedies &#151; the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>;\\nseveral Icelandic sagas, but especially <em>Burnt Njal</em>; the tale of Tristram and\\nIseult; the story of Arthur, Launcelot, and Guinevere; and the Irish Cuchulain cycle. </p>\\n\\n<p>Epics like <em>The Ramayana</em>, <em>Gilgamesh</em>, the story of the Holy Grail are\\nquests. Others are adventure stories like <em>Sinbad the Sailor</em>. When the latter\\npossess a dramatic structure, it is of the sort we would call comic. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is a collection of adventures, of little melodramas like the\\nearliest English and Scots Ballads, and of folktales like those in Grimm. The supernatural\\nappears not from Olympus, but on the level of fairy stories and superstitions. In\\ncontrast, there is nothing folkloristic about <em>The Iliad</em>. Its legendary materials\\nare myths. <em>The Iliad</em> never falters in its vision of the gods as personifications\\nof nonhuman forces herding men to their doom. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, Poseidon is only\\nthe unruly and unpredictable sea; Athena, the virtues of Odysseus himself projected on the\\nheavens. </p>\\n\\n<p>The virtues of Odysseus are not those of a warrior, but those of a merchant-adventurer\\nwho has wandered the ancient seas from Gibraltar to the Crimea and the Caucasus and has\\nsurvived and profited: agility, inventiveness, courage, prudence, and persistence. They\\ninclude neither heroic valor nor civic duty. Odysseus knows neither shame nor guilt. </p>\\n\\n<p>In <em>The Odyssey</em>, man is a part of nature. He can outwit nature, learn its\\nsecrets, use it. Its personifications are less than human and succumb to human wisdom or\\ncunning. The heroes of <em>The Iliad</em> are shaken and thwarted in their courses by vast\\npowers. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, men are continually tricked and tempted by <em>daimons</em>,\\nby malicious spirits, or by &#147;some god.&#148; Odysseus blames a malicious devil when\\nhe forgets to wear his cloak on a chilly night. The enchantresses of <em>The Odyssey</em>\\nare not archetypes of the grandeur, misery, and enervation of lust like Helen. They are\\nwitches; above all, they are the extravagantly satisfying whores that sailors wander the\\nsurface of the planet seeking to this day. Even Nausikaa bears an uncanny resemblance to\\nthat good girl the old bo&#146;sun met once in his far-off youth when he wandered into a\\nchurch social and who took him home to meet the folks. </p>\\n\\n<p>It is home that haunts <em>The Odyssey</em>, as it has haunted men in\\nfo&#146;c&#146;sles before and since. Although, like all sailors, Odysseus thinks he wants\\nto get home, again like all sailors, he spends an inordinate time doing it. The keystone\\nlines in <em>The Odyssey</em> which compare with Hector&#146;s last interview with his\\nwife and child, or Achilles&#146; with Priam, are in praise of marriage, yet they sound\\nsuspiciously ironic. </p>\\n\\n<p>The adventures of <em>The Odyssey</em> are fantastic, but their denouement is pure\\nfantasy. Odysseus&#146; return and slaughter of the suitors is the most outlandish thing\\nin Greek literature. No custom like it is known in the mercantile Levant of Homer&#146;s\\ntime, nor in the similar societies of the South Seas in the recent past. We have no reason\\nto believe that a wife whose husband had abandoned her for twenty years would remain\\nfaithful, that she would be persecuted by a mob of suitors who would move into her home\\nand struggle with one another for her hand and consume her substance. Nor has there ever\\nbeen any legal code or custom that would justify the husband in mercilessly slaughtering\\nthem all when he showed up incognito after twenty years. </p>\\n\\n<p>Something the story does resemble: the ever-recurring dream in the barren hotel rooms,\\ncrowded barracks, and fo&#146;c&#146;sles of traveling men, soldiers and sailors, long\\naway. &#147;Is my wife true to me? What is she doing now? Do they think of me at home?\\nWill my son recognize me when I get back? Are those fellows still pestering my wife? Has\\nshe given in to them? Do they hang around the house? Wait till I get back; I&#146;ll fix\\nthem.&#148; As dream and daydream, the climax of <em>The Odyssey</em> has been a universal\\nexperience of wandering husbands; as fact, it has not existed. Any seafaring society with\\nsuch a custom would have exterminated itself. </p>\\n\\n<p>All <em>The Odyssey</em> has a character of dream unlike the stark objectivity of <em>The\\nIliad</em>. The events of <em>The Iliad</em> follow one another, bright, swift, sure, and\\ndramatically necessary. The events of <em>The Odyssey</em> fade and dissolve; the\\nnarrative wanders in time; the pictures are brilliant, but they glitter through a mist of\\nreverie &#151; an old sailor musing over the glamour of his past. The texture of the verse\\nis light in <em>The Odyssey</em>; the imagery sparkles; but it never loses both its\\ndecorative delicacy of detail and its melancholy tone. <em>The Iliad</em> is full of the\\nthunder and lightning of the king of gods and men. When there is thunder in <em>The\\nOdyssey</em>, it is that of some foolish one-eyed giant whose fellows laugh at him. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is entertainment. It is entertainment of the highest order, but it\\nis difficult to imagine anyone saying, &#147;Reading <em>The Odyssey</em> changed my life\\nfundamentally.&#148; <em>The Iliad</em> can be read only superficially as entertainment.\\nIf we make ourselves available to it, it confronts us with a vision of the nature of\\nreality and the being of man. <em>The Iliad</em> says: &#147;This is life. It is tragic,\\nand if it has meaning, that meaning is an incommunicable mystery; it can be presented, but\\nnever explained.&#148; <em>The Odyssey</em> says: &#147;This is life. It is comic, and it\\nis full of meanings. These meanings are all the multiform techniques for living; they can\\nbe learned by work, intelligence, and a canny conscience.&#148; </p>\\n\\n<p>Tragedy is a posture; comedy is an activity. If one read enough comedies, they might\\nchange one&#146;s life fundamentally. Life as comedy can be learned; as tragedy it can\\nonly be assumed. Most men are predominantly one type or the other; an individual&#146;s\\nview of life is seldom equally balanced between tragedy and comedy. However, the dramatic\\nartists of the world&#146;s literature have usually written both; they have realized that\\nthere are two faces of the coin of life: on one side, the head of an implacable and\\nbeautiful god; on the other, a curious animal. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>Selections from Kenneth Rexroth&#146;s <em>Classics Revisited</em> (copyright 1968\\nKenneth Rexroth) and <em>More Classics Revisited</em> (copyright 1989 Kenneth Rexroth\\nTrust).

Gilgamesh was the\\nfifth king of the Sumerian city of Uruk after the Great Flood. Under his rule, about 2500\\nBC, Uruk conquered the surrounding city-states and established something like a small\\nnation. For two thousand years Gilgamesh survived in the Near East as an epic hero. There\\nare versions of his story in Hittite, Hurrian, Canaanite, Sumerian, and Assyrian, and the\\ndim memory of his fame in the Koran. The most complete text comes from Assurbanipal&#146;s\\nlibrary, formed just before the destruction of Nineveh in the seventh century BC. The\\nstory seems to have taken form almost two thousand years before that. Considering the\\ndisparity of cultures and languages, the great stretch of time, the means of reproduction\\nand communication, <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> is one of the most popular stories ever\\ntold. </p>\\n\\n<p>Rightly so. It may be the first, but it is a highly developed fictional narrative. It\\nis not a myth. Even to call it an epic requires a stretching of the definition. It is more\\nlike a novel of a modern, individualistic hero than it is like Homer&#146;s <em>Iliad</em>.\\nIt is a spiritual adventure, a story of self-realization, the discovery of the meaning of\\nthe personality, of a type that would never change down the four-thousand-year-long\\nhistory of human imagination. Its figures have the cogency of symbols that will never\\nalter. It is modern because it is like a dream of a modern man. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gilgamesh is not a demigod. In spite of his divine ancestry and the concern of the gods\\nof Mesopotamia with his adventures, in spite of those adventures&#146; wondrous character,\\nhe remains as secular as Stephen Dedalus. True, critics have taken the twelve tablets, or\\nchapters, of the Assyrian story as standing for the twelve houses of the Zodiac and\\nGilgamesh as the sun moving through the drama of the year. May be; but this is a symbolic\\nsubstructure as remote from the human problems of Gilgamesh as the identical substructure\\nis from the adventures of Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce&#146;s <em>Ulysses</em>. It would\\nbe possible to develop a convincing argument that <em>Tom Jones</em> is a sun myth; such\\nsymbolic patterns seem to be determinants of the imagination. What is important about\\nGilgamesh is that, like Tom Jones, he is a man. </p>\\n\\n<p>As King of Uruk, Gilgamesh has too much power for the good of his community. He\\ndeflowers the virgins, consumes the young men in war, works the elders to death building\\nthe city walls. The people appeal to the gods, who make him a companion of clay, the wild\\nman Enkidu, as a foil for his energy. Enkidu is tamed and brought to the city by a temple\\nprostitute. As Gilgamesh comes in the night to claim the <em>droit du seigneur</em> from a\\nnew-wedded bride, Enkidu grapples with him and they fight a mighty battle. Enkidu at last\\nis thrown; whereupon he and Gilgamesh embrace and swear eternal friendship. They set off\\nfor the Land of Cedars to bring back the great trees guarded by the fearful giant Humbaba.\\nThey are protected by the prayers of Gilgamesh&#146;s mother, the priestess-goddess\\nNinsun; watched over by Shamash, the sun god; and aided by the storm winds to defeat\\nHumbaba. When they return to Uruk in victory, the goddess Ishtar falls in love with\\nGilgamesh and offers herself to him. He rejects and insults her. She appeals to the gods\\nfor vengeance. Her father sends down the Bull of Heaven to destroy Gilgamesh. The\\ncompanions kill the Bull, cut out his heart, and offer it to Shamash, the sun god, and\\nEnkidu throws the thigh of the Bull in the face of Ishtar. The gods in council decide that\\none of the two heroes must die &#151; more for killing the Bull of Heaven and Humbaba and\\ncutting the sacred cedars than for insulting Ishtar. They smite Enkidu with a fatal\\ndisease. Enkidu&#146;s death and Gilgamesh&#146;s lament over his body are the finest\\npoetry of the whole story. </p>\\n\\n<p>Gilgamesh sets off across the world in quest of immortality. Eventually he comes to\\nUtnapishtim, the survivor of the Deluge, far away in the Western Ocean in the Garden of\\nthe Sun. Utnapishtim says that with the exception of himself, the gods have kept immortal\\nlife for themselves and allotted death to man. He tells Gilgamesh the story of the Deluge,\\na narrative that has many points in common with the later tale of Noah. Then he\\ndemonstrates that Gilgamesh cannot hold off sleep, much less death. However, Utnapishtim\\nshows him how to find an underwater plant that will restore youth. Gilgamesh dives down\\nand gets the plant, but loses it to a serpent on his way home. </p>\\n\\n<p>At last he comes back to Uruk and realizes that the mighty walls, the temples, and the\\ngardens that he had built are all the immortality he will ever know. And so he dies, and\\nthe citizens bury him with many offerings, and mourn his death. In the twentieth century,\\narcheologists find the remnants of the walls of Gilgamesh&#146;s Uruk still enduring, and\\nthe &#147;Gilgamesh motif,&#148; a man throttling two beasts, far away in time and place,\\non Anglo-Saxon jewelry at Sutton Hoo, above the North Sea. </p>\\n\\n<p>One reason why <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> still has great power to move us is a\\npoetic style that does not depend on elements like rhyme or meter but on rhetorical\\ndevices, parallelism and antithesis, and the antiphonal organization of short and long\\nphrases, all of which are translatable and which are worked into emotive patterns in the\\noriginals with consummate skill. These are characteristics <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>\\nshares with much Near Eastern poetry, notably with the <em>Psalms</em>, <em>The Song of\\nSongs</em>, the great Canticles of the Old Testament, the Song of Deborah in the book of <em>Judges</em>.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>This solemn style, like the words of some great ritual, is the direct embodiment of a\\nvision and judgment of the human condition that is permanent and universal. The absurdity\\nof life and death, heroic wistfulness, nostalgia for lost possibilities, melancholy of\\nmissed perfection were as meaningful five thousand years ago to the Sumerians as they are\\nto us. We look at them today in museum cases &#151; round heads, curly hair, immense eyes\\nand noses, plump hands folded over plump chests, cloaks like leaves or feathers &#151; and\\nthey look out at us, and we know that they knew that the love of comrades cannot prevail\\nagainst the insult of death, that erotic women destroy men with impossible demands, that\\nnothing endures, that the memory of heroic action lasts a little while and sometimes the\\nwalls of empire a little longer, that the meaning of life can be revealed but never\\nexplained, and that the realization of these truths constitutes the achievement of true\\npersonality. From the first narrative in the world&#146;s literature Gilgamesh emerges as\\nthe first conscious self. In the course of four thousand years of fiction,\\nself-consciousness will be achieved in many different and more elaborate ways, but it will\\nin fact and essence vary not at all. </p>\\n\\n<p align=\"center\">* * * </p>\\n\\n<p>Since the discovery of the Assyrian tablets in the last century there have been several\\nEnglish versions of <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>. The best is the one by N.K. Sandars in\\nthe Penguin Classics. It is in natural English, devoid of false archaisms; all the known\\ntexts have been woven into the narrative with taste and skill; and the fifty pages of\\nintroduction are as helpful and informative as could be desired. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h1 align=\"center\"><a name=\"Homer, The Iliad\">Homer, <em>The Iliad</em></a> </h1>\\n\\n<p><br>\\nThe best-qualified critics have always agreed that the first work of Western European\\nliterature has remained incomparably the greatest. In itself this is a revelation of the\\nnature of the human mind and of the role of works of art. This is a popular judgment as\\nwell as a critical one. Today, over twenty-five centuries old, Homer competes successfully\\nwith current best sellers and detective stories and the most sensational and topical\\nnonfiction. </p>\\n\\n<p>Modern Americans may be the heirs of Western Civilization, but all the elements of that\\ncivilization have changed drastically since Homer&#146;s day. The office worker who reads\\nHomer on the subway on the way to work bears little superficial resemblance to either\\nHomer&#146;s characters or his audience. Why should two long poems about the life of\\nbarbaric Greece have so great an appeal? </p>\\n\\n<p>It was the fashion in the nineteenth century to deny the existence of Homer and to\\nbreak up <em>The Odyssey</em> and <em>The Iliad</em> into collections of folk ballads.\\nNothing disproves those theories more than this public reception. <em>The Iliad</em> and <em>The\\nOdyssey</em> have been read by such a vast diversity of men because they are unitary works\\nof art and deal with universal experience with unsurpassed depth, breadth, and intensity.\\nEach poem shows the powerful insight and organization that come from the artistic craft of\\na complete person. </p>\\n\\n<p>Men have argued about <em>The Iliad</em> for so long and raised so many side issues\\nthat it is easy for a critic to forget that it is formally a tragedy, saturated with a\\ntragic sense of life and constructed with the inevitability of the tragedy of Orestes or\\nMacbeth. It is a double tragedy &#151; of Achilles and the Greeks and of Hector and the\\nTrojans, each reinforcing the other. To modern taste, the heroes are not the Greeks, who\\nare portrayed as quarreling members of a warrior band, but the Trojans, men of family\\nunited in the community of the city-state. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer, like most later writers of epic, Teutonic, Irish, or Icelandic, portrays heroic\\nvalor as fundamentally destructive, not just of social order, but of humane community. The\\nGreeks are doomed by their characteristic virtues. Achilles sulks in his tent; Agamemnon\\nhas stolen his girl. The Greek camp is beset with a disorder that wastes all good things.\\nUnderlying disorder is violence. Violence is not approved of in itself by the Greeks, but\\nall the values that they most admire &#151; the nobility, pride and power, glamour and\\nstrength of barbaric chieftains &#151; flourish only in the context of violence and must\\nbe fed by it continuously. Failure of these values provokes shame, the opposite of the\\nassumption of responsibility, and shame provokes disaster. </p>\\n\\n<p>On the other side of the wall, the Trojans go their orderly and dignified ways. None of\\nthem approves of the crime of Paris, but he is a member of the family of the King of Troy,\\nand the citizens of Troy are members one of another. So they assume his guilt in an act of\\ncollective responsibility. When the Greeks arrived before the walls of Troy, the Trojans\\ncould have thrown Paris and Helen out of the city. The invaders would have gone their way.\\nWhen <em>The Iliad</em> opens, the Greeks have been fighting for ten years and are worn\\nout with the moral attrition of war, while the Trojans have grown ever closer together in\\nthe consciousness of doom. &#147;Our lot is best, to fight for our country,&#148; says\\nHector; and Homer implies a contrast with the Greeks, who are fighting for themselves,\\neach for his own valor and pride. </p>\\n\\n<p>Greeks and Trojans are not the only protagonists of this tragedy. There is another\\ncommunity &#151; the gods of Olympus. In the vast literature of Homeric criticism, I have\\nnever read a mention of what kind of community this was, of where in Homer&#146;s day he\\ncould have found an earthly parallel to such a group of people. The court of Zeus is\\nprecisely a court, like those to be found in the great empires of the ancient Near East\\n&#151; in Egypt, Babylon, or Persia. After Homer, for a few hundred years, Greek society\\nstrove to rise above the tyrant and the court of the tyrant. The Greeks of the Classical\\nperiod looked on the rulers of Persia or Egypt and their provincial imitators in the Greek\\nworld as at once frivolous and dangerous, because, in Greek opinion, they were motivated\\nnot by the moral consensus of a responsible community, but by the whims of what today we\\nwould call a collection of celebrities. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer contrasts the societies of the Greeks, the Trojans, and the Olympian gods as the\\nthree forms of political association that prevailed in the Heroic Age (a time that in\\nfact, four hundred years before, must have seemed almost as remote to him as his age does\\nto us): the barbaric war band; the ancient, Bronze Age, pre-Greek city-state; and the\\nimperial court. He also contrasts men and gods as two disparate orders of being. The gods\\nmay behave like painted and perfumed courtiers of the Persian King of Kings, but they\\nfunction also as conceptual forms of the forces of nature and of the forces that operate\\nwithin the human personality on nonhuman levels. In this role, too, the tragedy of <em>The\\nIliad</em> reveals them as frivolous, dangerous, and unpredictable. </p>\\n\\n<p>True, Homer speaks worshipfully at times of the gods, and especially of Zeus &#151; but\\nin terms of standardized flattery, empty of moral content. Utterly unlike that of the Jew\\nor Muslim or Christian, Homer&#146;s view of the supernatural is devoid of value\\naltogether. Value arises only in the relations of men. He contrasts two different systems\\nof relationships: the epic chivalry of the Heroic Age war band of the Greeks, and the\\nTrojan community of mutual respect and responsibility. The conflicts and resolutions and\\ntragedies that beset the interactions of these human beings are all the good and evil\\nthere is to be found in <em>The Iliad</em>. The gods contribute only chance, fate, doom\\n&#151; as amoral as so many roulette wheels. </p>\\n\\n<p>Homer has been read for almost three thousand years, and is read today by millions,\\nbecause he portrayed men in the night-bound world of insensate circumstance, as being each\\nman to his fellow the only light there is, and all men to one another &#151; as the source\\nof the only principle of order. This, says Homer, is the human condition. Out of it in <em>The\\nIliad</em> he constructed a dramatic architecture of a cogency never to be surpassed. </p>\\n\\n<p>Each time I put down <em>The Iliad</em>, after reading it again in some new\\ntranslation, or after reading once more the somber splendor of the Greek, I am convinced,\\nas one is convinced by the experiences of a lifetime, that somehow, in a way beyond the\\nvisions of artistry, I have been face to face with the meaning of existence. Other works\\nof literature give this insight, but none so powerfully, so uncontaminated by evasion or\\nsubterfuge. If the art of poetry is a symbolic criticism of value, <em>The Iliad</em> is\\nthe paramount classic of that art. Its purity, simplicity, definition, and impact reveal\\nlife and expose it to irrevocable judgment, with finality and at the beginning of European\\nliterature. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<h1 align=\"center\"><a name=\"Homer, The Odyssey\">Homer, <em>The Odyssey</em></a> </h1>\\n\\n<p><br>\\nIn all the melee on the Trojan plain, there is one person who always takes the\\ncommon-sense point of view. He is cunning, prudent, imperturbable. He always seeks the\\ngreatest return for the least expenditure of blood or spirit. This is Odysseus. Amongst\\nthe Levantine Trojans and the Viking-like Greeks, caught up in the irrationality of\\ncircumstance and broken against their own contradictions, he seems an intruder from\\nanother time. And so he is. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Iliad</em> is a symphonic work of art. The double theme with its intense\\npolarity is modulated, retarded, and quickened, yet moves relentlessly to climax and\\nrecapitulation. The only devices in <em>The Odyssey</em> are flashbacks in time, the\\nnarratives within the narrative. They complicate the structure; they do not compound it.\\nThe episode with Nausikaa is self-sufficient and is written with such poignancy and\\nclarity that it led Samuel Butler to &#147;prove&#148; that <em>The Odyssey</em> was\\nwritten by Nausikaa herself. </p>\\n\\n<p>Only a few stories of the various Heroic Ages, those we think of as preeminently epic,\\nare concerned with the working out of an inexorable doom, the consequence of sin, folly,\\nand flaws of character in the protagonists. These few are tragedies &#151; the <em>Nibelungenlied</em>;\\nseveral Icelandic sagas, but especially <em>Burnt Njal</em>; the tale of Tristram and\\nIseult; the story of Arthur, Launcelot, and Guinevere; and the Irish Cuchulain cycle. </p>\\n\\n<p>Epics like <em>The Ramayana</em>, <em>Gilgamesh</em>, the story of the Holy Grail are\\nquests. Others are adventure stories like <em>Sinbad the Sailor</em>. When the latter\\npossess a dramatic structure, it is of the sort we would call comic. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is a collection of adventures, of little melodramas like the\\nearliest English and Scots Ballads, and of folktales like those in Grimm. The supernatural\\nappears not from Olympus, but on the level of fairy stories and superstitions. In\\ncontrast, there is nothing folkloristic about <em>The Iliad</em>. Its legendary materials\\nare myths. <em>The Iliad</em> never falters in its vision of the gods as personifications\\nof nonhuman forces herding men to their doom. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, Poseidon is only\\nthe unruly and unpredictable sea; Athena, the virtues of Odysseus himself projected on the\\nheavens. </p>\\n\\n<p>The virtues of Odysseus are not those of a warrior, but those of a merchant-adventurer\\nwho has wandered the ancient seas from Gibraltar to the Crimea and the Caucasus and has\\nsurvived and profited: agility, inventiveness, courage, prudence, and persistence. They\\ninclude neither heroic valor nor civic duty. Odysseus knows neither shame nor guilt. </p>\\n\\n<p>In <em>The Odyssey</em>, man is a part of nature. He can outwit nature, learn its\\nsecrets, use it. Its personifications are less than human and succumb to human wisdom or\\ncunning. The heroes of <em>The Iliad</em> are shaken and thwarted in their courses by vast\\npowers. In <em>The Odyssey</em>, men are continually tricked and tempted by <em>daimons</em>,\\nby malicious spirits, or by &#147;some god.&#148; Odysseus blames a malicious devil when\\nhe forgets to wear his cloak on a chilly night. The enchantresses of <em>The Odyssey</em>\\nare not archetypes of the grandeur, misery, and enervation of lust like Helen. They are\\nwitches; above all, they are the extravagantly satisfying whores that sailors wander the\\nsurface of the planet seeking to this day. Even Nausikaa bears an uncanny resemblance to\\nthat good girl the old bo&#146;sun met once in his far-off youth when he wandered into a\\nchurch social and who took him home to meet the folks. </p>\\n\\n<p>It is home that haunts <em>The Odyssey</em>, as it has haunted men in\\nfo&#146;c&#146;sles before and since. Although, like all sailors, Odysseus thinks he wants\\nto get home, again like all sailors, he spends an inordinate time doing it. The keystone\\nlines in <em>The Odyssey</em> which compare with Hector&#146;s last interview with his\\nwife and child, or Achilles&#146; with Priam, are in praise of marriage, yet they sound\\nsuspiciously ironic. </p>\\n\\n<p>The adventures of <em>The Odyssey</em> are fantastic, but their denouement is pure\\nfantasy. Odysseus&#146; return and slaughter of the suitors is the most outlandish thing\\nin Greek literature. No custom like it is known in the mercantile Levant of Homer&#146;s\\ntime, nor in the similar societies of the South Seas in the recent past. We have no reason\\nto believe that a wife whose husband had abandoned her for twenty years would remain\\nfaithful, that she would be persecuted by a mob of suitors who would move into her home\\nand struggle with one another for her hand and consume her substance. Nor has there ever\\nbeen any legal code or custom that would justify the husband in mercilessly slaughtering\\nthem all when he showed up incognito after twenty years. </p>\\n\\n<p>Something the story does resemble: the ever-recurring dream in the barren hotel rooms,\\ncrowded barracks, and fo&#146;c&#146;sles of traveling men, soldiers and sailors, long\\naway. &#147;Is my wife true to me? What is she doing now? Do they think of me at home?\\nWill my son recognize me when I get back? Are those fellows still pestering my wife? Has\\nshe given in to them? Do they hang around the house? Wait till I get back; I&#146;ll fix\\nthem.&#148; As dream and daydream, the climax of <em>The Odyssey</em> has been a universal\\nexperience of wandering husbands; as fact, it has not existed. Any seafaring society with\\nsuch a custom would have exterminated itself. </p>\\n\\n<p>All <em>The Odyssey</em> has a character of dream unlike the stark objectivity of <em>The\\nIliad</em>. The events of <em>The Iliad</em> follow one another, bright, swift, sure, and\\ndramatically necessary. The events of <em>The Odyssey</em> fade and dissolve; the\\nnarrative wanders in time; the pictures are brilliant, but they glitter through a mist of\\nreverie &#151; an old sailor musing over the glamour of his past. The texture of the verse\\nis light in <em>The Odyssey</em>; the imagery sparkles; but it never loses both its\\ndecorative delicacy of detail and its melancholy tone. <em>The Iliad</em> is full of the\\nthunder and lightning of the king of gods and men. When there is thunder in <em>The\\nOdyssey</em>, it is that of some foolish one-eyed giant whose fellows laugh at him. </p>\\n\\n<p><em>The Odyssey</em> is entertainment. It is entertainment of the highest order, but it\\nis difficult to imagine anyone saying, &#147;Reading <em>The Odyssey</em> changed my life\\nfundamentally.&#148; <em>The Iliad</em> can be read only superficially as entertainment.\\nIf we make ourselves available to it, it confronts us with a vision of the nature of\\nreality and the being of man. <em>The Iliad</em> says: &#147;This is life. It is tragic,\\nand if it has meaning, that meaning is an incommunicable mystery; it can be presented, but\\nnever explained.&#148; <em>The Odyssey</em> says: &#147;This is life. It is comic, and it\\nis full of meanings. These meanings are all the multiform techniques for living; they can\\nbe learned by work, intelligence, and a canny conscience.&#148; </p>\\n\\n<p>Tragedy is a posture; comedy is an activity. If one read enough comedies, they might\\nchange one&#146;s life fundamentally. Life as comedy can be learned; as tragedy it can\\nonly be assumed. Most men are predominantly one type or the other; an individual&#146;s\\nview of life is seldom equally balanced between tragedy and comedy. However, the dramatic\\nartists of the world&#146;s literature have usually written both; they have realized that\\nthere are two faces of the coin of life: on one side, the head of an implacable and\\nbeautiful god; on the other, a curious animal. </p>\\n\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n<hr color=\"#FF0000\">\\n\\n<p>Selections from Kenneth Rexroth&#146;s <em>Classics Revisited</em> (copyright 1968\\nKenneth Rexroth) and <em>More Classics Revisited</em> (copyright 1989 Kenneth Rexroth\\nTrust).
